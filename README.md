📊 Simple Linear Regression — Cost Function Implementation <br><br>
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Simple Linear Regression model from scratch using Python, focusing on understanding and visualizing the cost function (Mean Squared Error - MSE).<br><br>

🚀 Features <br><br>
Implements gradient descent to minimize the cost function.

Calculates and plots the cost surface and contour plot.

Predicts house prices based on input square footage.

Helps in building an intuitive understanding of how parameters w and b affect the MSE.<br><br>
